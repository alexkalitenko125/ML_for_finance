# ML_for_finance
ML for finance forecasting (colab version).

This project was created to test the ability to predict the behavior of the stock market in stable times when force majeure is insignificant. Neural networks can take into account some price periodicity, trends, and correlations between index values. For example, oil and gas prices only affect rubles and the MOEX index after a while, in turn, the ruble and MOEX affect each other. The author's projects are presented here. So far, recurrent networks and conventional fully connected ones have been used as models, which were built intuitively and adjusted for maximum predictive accuracy based on a subjective assessment, as well as the basics of technical market analysis.

This project may be useful for specialists in financial analytics or the scientific field. Please refer to the repository when using it.

By going through and learning from the basics of technical analysis, the following scheme looks promising.
